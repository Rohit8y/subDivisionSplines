Q-1 Tessellated quadratic and cubic B-splines: 
The logic of quadratic and cubic b-spline is implemented in Tessellation Evaluation Shader. To define if we have to run quadratic or cubic b-splines, manual changes are required in the TCS (output layout = n)and TES file(type = 4 or 5). The TCS and TES file has proper documentation about this.
